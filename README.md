# Bike-Sharing-Model-Selection-and-Logistic-Regression
OLS Regression analysis on the the Bike Sharing Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) to fit certain models with various complexities
## Skills Needed to Complete this Project
- Cross Validation
- Hold Out Method
- Newton-Ralphson Convergence Method
- Logistic Regression
- Theory behind OLS
- Understanding of MSE maximization 

## Motivation for the Assignment
OLS Regression analysis can be used to answer the following question: <br /> *What is the predicted number of riders for a Sunday that is expected to be sunny and cool (around 75 F degrees)?*
We may try to predict ridership, given the weather conditions, day of the week, time of the year and so on.This type of prediction could actually be useful for bike-sharing services that may need to prepare for dayswith high demand.Using the daily data set (i.e. `fileday.csv`), the idea is to fit various models of different complexity and examine some of their outputs to assess their predictive performance.
